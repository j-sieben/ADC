As an example, if the designer shows a rule group, because the user clicked on a dynamic page in the tree control, The mode is CGR and the command is SHOW. Based on this information, this view is queried and the status and labels of the respective buttons are taken and sent to the page. The decision table also defines the target mode to switch to if a button is clicked.&nbsp; If the user decides to click the CREATE button in the ADC Designer, this then is interpreted as target mode CRU and the command is CREATE-ACTION. This again filters this view, controling the state of the buttons and labels as well as the target modes of the buttons.</div></div>"});
