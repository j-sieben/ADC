NDContentPage.OnToolTipsLoaded({243:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TDatabaseView LSQL\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">This view enriches the data from the decision table Tables.ADC_UI_MAP_DESIGNER_ACTIONS with translated label data and session state information, such as the actual page and region prefix.&nbsp; The decision is based on a mode the ADC Designer is actually in and the command to execute. As an example, if the designer shows a rule group, because the user clicked on a dynamic page in the tree control, The mode is CGR and the command is SHOW. Based on this information, this view is queried and the status and labels of the respective buttons are taken and sent to the page. The decision table also defines the target mode to switch to if a button is clicked.&nbsp; If the user decides to click the CREATE button in the ADC Designer, this then is interpreted as target mode CRU and the command is CREATE-ACTION. This again filters this view, controling the state of the buttons and labels as well as the target modes of the buttons.</div></div>"});
