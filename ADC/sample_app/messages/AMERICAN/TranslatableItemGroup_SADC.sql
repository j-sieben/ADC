This allows to control the label as well as the behavior. In the example, a modal window is opened to edit the employee if this is allowed, and a warning is shown if this is not allowed. Please note that this is almost impossible to implement in APEX without ADC, because a link to an application page cannot be changed dynamically.</p><p>The method for controlling the page command uses the ADC_APEX_ACTION auxiliary package. This selects the action and then controls the behavior.

Likewise, you can turn individual actions on or off.

The plugin does not require any parameterization on the application page.</p><h3>Use ADC on all application pages</h3><p>Alternatively, the plugin can be included on page 0 and is thus available on all application pages. This way is also useful if you want to control most pages with ADC, but exclude some from this. In this case, add a server-side condition that prevents the plugin from running on those pages.</p><h3>Create a page template for ADC</h3><p>As a third option, you can also create a page template that automatically references ADC. In this case, add the following code in the JavaScript section of the page template:</p><p>&lt;TODO: Create code&gt;</p><p>This way is useful if you want to make it as easy as possible for your developers to include ADC and, on the other hand, keep the flexibility of wanting to use ADC only for some application pages. </p><p>This application uses the plugin on page 0, so it is available to all application pages.</p><h3>Making application page available in ADC management application</h3><p>Once you have inserted a new page and set up ADC for that page in one of the ways described, you need to run that page once to register it in the ADC management application. You can then enter use cases for that application page. Note that page elements must be present on the application page for meaningful use cases to be captured.</p><p>Also note that ADC cannot automatically detect whether you have modified a page in APEX.
